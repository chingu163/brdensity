Deep Learning Approach to Mammographic Breast Density Estimation using Tensorflow/Keras (with Convolutional Neural Network)

This collection accompanies the RSNA abstract for "Practical Approach to using Tensorflow for Computer Vision Research in Radiology: a case example with mammography" It serves as a tutorai for physicians and researchers in medical field to have better understanding of how to actually use deep learning in clinical research.

This project uses basic convolutional neural network structuer called VGG16. There are better pretrained models out there including ResNet, Inception, Xception, and etc. However, I want to focus on simple models first as an introduction.
