Practical Guide to Deep Learning for Computer Vision Research in Radiology

This collection accompanies the 2017 RSNA educational exhibit abstract. The purpose of the exhibit is to provide very practical coding tutorial for setting up a convolutional neural network to solve a radiology question. We will be using a public mammography dataset to predict breast density. 

This project uses basic convolutional neural network structure called VGG16. There are better pretrained models out there including ResNet, Inception, Xception, and etc that will be explored as well.
